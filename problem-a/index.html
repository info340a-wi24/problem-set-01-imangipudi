    <h3>&#10024;Things I Admire about Shrek &#10024;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class="highlight-color">Shrek broke into fairy godmother's potion factory and posed as the workers union in order 
            to steal a potion for Fiona and drank it without knowing the consequences, he was willing 
            to give up his life as an ogre and become a human if that was what made Fiona happy.
        </li>
        <li>Shrek became friends with Puss and Boots even though he tried to kill Shrek</li>
        <li>Shrek was very cool in the "Bad Reputation" fighting montage in Duloc</li>
    </ul>
